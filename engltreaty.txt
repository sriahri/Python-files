Queen Elizabeth I of England and Ireland, last monarch of the Tudor dynasty, died without issue on March, and the throne fell at once and uncontroversially to her first cousin twice removed, James VI of Scotland, a member of the House of Stuart and the only son of Mary, Queen of Scots. By the Union of the Crowns in he assumed the throne of the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Ireland as King James I. This personal union lessened the constant English fears of Scottish cooperation with France in a feared French invasion of England.
