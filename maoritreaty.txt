The treaty was written at a time when the New Zealand Company, acting on behalf of large numbers of settlers and would-be settlers, were establishing a colony in New Zealand, and when some leaders had petitioned the British for protection against French incursions. It was drafted with the intention of establishing a British Governor of New Zealand, recognising ownership of their lands, forests and other possessions, and giving the rights of British subjects. It was intended by the British Crown to ensure that when Lieutenant Governor William Hobson subsequently made the declaration of British sovereignty over New Zealand in May, the people would not feel that their rights had been ignored.Once it had been written and translated, it was first signed by Northern leaders at Waitangi. Copies were subsequently taken around New Zealand and over the following months many other chiefs signed.
